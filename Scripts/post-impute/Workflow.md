GWAS functional mapping:

- GWAS glm assocation with RESV, covars PC 1-5, age, pre-exisiting conditions
- GWAS 'suggested top hits' threshold = sig p < 9.9 x10e-5

- Annotation of top hits with SNPnexus: nearest gene, histone feautres, cadd score, public hits, pathway analysis
- Annotation of all SNPs using FUMA (lifted back to 37 build): Linkage disequilibrium, gene annotation, gtex results, chromatin mapping

- Cis and trans-eQTL analysis of top hits with V0 gene expression - matrix eQTL
- p value threshold = FDR p <0.05, cis distance = 1MB

To do:

- Cibersort of gene expression, rerun eqtl analysis
- Collate data visualisation
